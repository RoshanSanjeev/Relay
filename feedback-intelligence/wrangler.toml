# FRICTION LOG COMMENT:
# Connecting multiple Cloudflare products required understanding which binding types exist
# and how they relate to actual resources. The documentation mentions "how to add bindings"
# but doesn't clearly show a minimal working example with D1, R2, AI, and Vectorize together.

[env.production]
# This ensures we can use different resources for dev vs production
route = "feedback-intelligence.account.workers.dev"

# R2 Bucket Binding
# FRICTION: Setting up R2 requires creating the bucket first in the dashboard.
# Then you need to know the exact binding name to use in code.
[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "R2_BUCKET"
bucket_name = "feedback-raw"
preview_bucket_name = "feedback-raw-dev"

# D1 Database Binding
# FRICTION: D1 requires database_id from dashboard. No clear way to auto-create
# via wrangler.toml - must use dashboard or local SQLite for development.
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "D1_DB"
database_name = "feedback-db"
database_id = "ec6a2e32-578d-4b96-8d14-a3a68613ce24"

# Workers AI Binding
# FRICTION: AI binding is simpler, but documentation doesn't show which models are available
# without visiting the models page separately.
[ai]
binding = "AI"

# Vectorize Binding (AI Search)
# FRICTION: Vectorize index_name must match an actual index created in dashboard.
# No local emulation available - makes development harder.
[[vectorize]]
binding = "VECTORIZE_INDEX"
index_name = "feedback-vectors"

# Workflow Binding
# FRICTION: Workflows binding is less documented. Had to find examples to understand
# how to trigger workflows from a Worker.

binding = "WORKFLOW"
class_name = "ProcessFeedbackWorkflow"
